### 🚀 Resume Builder - Full-Stack AWS Application
- A dynamic web application built with Next.js and n8n that allows users to create, preview, and download professionally styled PDF resumes in real-time.
- Deployed the entire application to AWS, hosting the frontend on Amplify and a containerized n8n backend on EC2 secured with HTTPS.

### 🖼️ Serverless Image Processing – AWS Serverless Application  
An event-driven application that automatically resizes images uploaded to Amazon S3 using AWS Lambda, S3 triggers, and IAM roles.  
Built the Lambda function in Python with Pillow for image manipulation and configured CloudWatch for monitoring and logging.  
The system runs entirely serverless, ensuring scalability, automation, and minimal operational overhead.

- **Tech Stack:** AWS (Lambda, S3, IAM, CloudWatch), Python, Pillow
